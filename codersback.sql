They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services,[15] but the real-world value of the coins is extremely volatile.[16] Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.[17] Users choose to participate in the digital currency for a number of reasons: ideologies such as commitment to anarchism, decentralization and libertarianism, convenience, using the currency as an investment and pseudonymity of transactions. Increased use has led to a desire among governments for regulation in order to tax, facilitate legal use in trade and for other reasons (such as investigations for money laundering and price manipulation).', '', '2021-04-24 02:08:41'),

Hardware is so-termed because it is \"hard\" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is \"soft\" because it is easy to change.\r\n\r\nHardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction.
